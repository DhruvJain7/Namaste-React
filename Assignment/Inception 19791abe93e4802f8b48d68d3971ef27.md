Q2. Difference between a Library and a Framework?

### **Library:**

1. **Definition:** A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can call upon to perform common tasks.
2. **Usage:** Developers have more control and can choose when and where to use the library functions. You call the library functions as needed in your code.
3. **Flexibility:** Offers greater flexibility as you can integrate it into your projects as you see fit.
4. **Examples:** jQuery (for JavaScript), NumPy (for Python), and React (for JavaScript, though it's often called a framework, it behaves more like a library).

### **Framework:**

1. **Definition:** A framework is a comprehensive platform that provides a foundation and structure for developing software applications.
2. **Usage:** The framework dictates the architecture and flow of the application. It often calls your code within its context.
3. **Control:** Offers less control compared to libraries because the framework enforces its structure and best practices.
4. **Examples:** Angular (for JavaScript), Django (for Python), and Ruby on Rails (for Ruby).

### **Key Differences:**

- **Inversion of Control:** In a library, you control the flow, but in a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework. This concept is known as “Inversion of Control.”
- **Usage Context:** Libraries are generally used for specific tasks, while frameworks provide a complete environment for application development.

Q3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver internet content quickly and efficiently to users. 

- **Distributed Servers:** A CDN consists of multiple servers located in different geographical locations around the world.
- **Content Caching:** These servers cache (store) copies of static content such as images, videos, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and other web assets.
- **Edge Servers:** The servers closest to the user, known as edge servers, deliver the cached content to the user.

### **Why do we use a CDN?**

1. **Speed and Performance:**
    - **Reduced Latency:** By serving content from the nearest server, CDNs reduce the time it takes for data to travel from the server to the user, resulting in faster load times.
    - **Improved User Experience:** Faster load times enhance the overall user experience, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction.
2. **Reliability and Availability:**
    - **Load Balancing:** CDNs distribute the traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overloaded.
    - **Redundancy:** If one server goes down, the content can still be delivered from another server in the network, ensuring high availability.
3. **Scalability:**
    - **Handling Traffic Spikes:** CDNs can handle large amounts of traffic and sudden spikes in demand, making them ideal for websites with high or unpredictable traffic.
4. **Security:**
    - **DDoS Protection:** CDNs can help protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by absorbing and mitigating the attack traffic.
    - **Secure Delivery:** Many CDNs offer additional security features such as SSL/TLS encryption, secure token authentication, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) services.

### **Examples of CDNs:**

- **Akamai:** One of the largest and most widely used CDNs.
- **Cloudflare:** Provides both CDN services and security features.
- **Amazon CloudFront:** Part of Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering CDN capabilities.

Q4.Why is React known as React?

The name "React" comes from the concept of reacting to changes. React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where dynamic content changes frequently.

Here are a few key reasons behind the name:

1. **Reactive Updates:** React efficiently updates and renders components when data changes. It "reacts" to state changes by automatically updating the UI to reflect the new state.
2. **Declarative Programming:** React allows developers to describe how the UI should look based on the current state. When the state changes, React reacts by updating the UI accordingly.
3. **User Interaction:** React focuses on creating interactive UIs, where the application responds quickly to user inputs and changes in data.

React's ability to respond and adapt to changes in data and user interactions is central to its design philosophy, hence the name "React."

Q 5. What is crossorigin in script tag?

The `crossorigin` attribute in HTML is used when you need to include resources (like images, scripts, or fonts) from a different origin (domain) and want to control how those resources are handled in terms of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It can have two values:

- `anonymous`: This value lets your resource request proceed without credentials (like cookies). It’s commonly used when you don’t need to authenticate users.
- `use-credentials`: This value includes credentials with the request, allowing access to authenticated resources from another domain.

Both these functionalities improve the performance and security of web applications in different, yet complementary ways.

In simpler words,

Absolutely! Imagine you're hosting a party and you invite friends from another neighborhood. When they come over, you have a few rules to ensure everyone has a good time.

1. **anonymous**: This is like telling your friends, "Come as you are, no need to bring anything special." They can join the party without any extra identification or credentials.
2. **use-credentials**: This is like asking your friends to bring their invitation cards with them. They need to show these invitations (credentials) at the door to gain access.

The `crossorigin` attribute in HTML works similarly when your website invites resources (like images or scripts) from another "neighborhood" (domain). It helps manage how these resources are accessed and shared securely.

Q 6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM?

- **Core Functionality vs. DOM Interaction:** React focuses on building and managing components, while ReactDOM handles the rendering of those components into the web page.
- **Platform Independence:** React is platform-agnostic, meaning it can be used beyond web applications (e.g., React Native for mobile apps). ReactDOM is specific to web applications and works with the browser's DOM.
- **Usage:** You need React to create the components and manage their state, and you need ReactDOM to render those components to the web page.

In summary, React provides the building blocks for creating UI components, while ReactDOM is responsible for rendering those components into the web browser's DOM.

Q7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

The `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files are two different versions of the React library, designed for different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### **react.development.js:**

1. **Purpose:** This file is intended for development environments.
2. **Features:** It includes additional warnings, error messages, and runtime checks to help developers identify and debug issues during the development process.
3. **Size:** It is larger in size because it contains extra code for development tools and error-checking mechanisms.
4. **Performance:** It is not optimized for performance, as the focus is on providing useful information for debugging.

### **react.production.js:**

1. **Purpose:** This file is intended for production environments.
2. **Features:** It has all the development-specific code removed, so it does not include the extra warnings and error messages.
3. **Size:** It is smaller in size because it is minified and stripped of unnecessary code.
4. **Performance:** It is optimized for performance, providing a faster and more efficient runtime experience for end users.

### **Key Differences:**

- **Usage Context:** `react.development.js` is used during the development phase to assist with debugging, while `react.production.js` is used in the production phase to ensure optimal performance.
- **Error Messages:** The development version provides detailed error messages and warnings that help developers catch and fix issues early. The production version does not include these messages to keep the file size small and the performance high.
- **Size:** The development version is larger due to the additional debugging code, while the production version is smaller and minified.

Q8. What is async and defer? 

n HTML, the `async` and `defer` attributes are used with the `<script>` tag to control the loading and execution of external JavaScript files. They help improve the performance and user experience of web pages by managing how scripts are loaded and executed.

### **Async:**

- **Definition:** The `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script file asynchronously, meaning it can be loaded in the background while the HTML document continues to be parsed.
- **Execution:** Once the script is downloaded, it will be executed immediately, even if the HTML parsing is not yet complete. This can potentially interrupt the parsing of the HTML document.
- **Use Case:** The `async` attribute is suitable for scripts that are independent of other scripts and do not rely on the DOM being fully loaded.

**Example:**

html

`<script src="script.js" async></script>`

### **Defer:**

- **Definition:** The `defer` attribute also tells the browser to download the script file asynchronously, but it differs in how it handles execution.
- **Execution:** Scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed only after the HTML document has been completely parsed. This ensures that the script execution does not interrupt the HTML parsing process.
- **Use Case:** The `defer` attribute is suitable for scripts that rely on the DOM being fully loaded, such as those that manipulate or interact with the DOM.

**Example:**

html

`<script src="script.js" defer></script>`

### **Key Differences:**

- **Timing:** `async` scripts are executed as soon as they are downloaded, while `defer` scripts are executed after the HTML parsing is complete.
- **Order:** Multiple `async` scripts may execute in any order as they download, but `defer` scripts maintain their order of execution as they appear in the document.

By using `async` and `defer`, you can improve the performance of your web pages by ensuring that scripts load efficiently without blocking the rendering of the HTML content.
